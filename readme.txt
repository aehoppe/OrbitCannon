Welcome to Intercontinental Ballistic Targeting! The name changed due to a change in design question. 

This repository is a mix of current and legacy code. The important MATLAB functions are: 

orbitFirstCut2Plot.m -- Plots a single launch trajectory given launch angle and velocity

plotTargeting.m -- Plots a trajectory that lands at a given latitude

targeting.m -- returns a launch angle and velocity for a given target latitude
